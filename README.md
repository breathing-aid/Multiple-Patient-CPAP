# Multiple-Patient-CPAP
CPAP Ventilator for multiple patients made from industrial components

-	Quickly available in large numbers
-	Specific for COVID-19
-	Easy to use
-	Easy to build locally
-	Open design: free to use 

**Overview**

Due to the spread of the Covid-19 virus, there is a shortage of ventilators. This is because conventional, medical-grade ventilators are complex and productions cannot be ramped up quickly enough to meet the current requirements. This proposal permits large quantities of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) ventilators to be constructed from widely available components using the simplest technology possible. Depending on the patientâ€™s acceptance, the treatment mode can also be switched to high-flow or BiPAP. The design is shared, and contribution is welcome.

**Status:**

The concept has been developed during the last few weeks and was realized in a prototype assembly for three patients. This system is currently being tested and reviewed by medical professionals. We created construction plans, dimensioning tables, CAD Models and operation manuals. These are shared for parallel manufacturing and deployment in different locations.

**Realization:**

We will provide the necessary documentation required to build and operate an array. This includes construction plans, dimensioning tables, CAD models and operation manuals. To build a facility, a local partner would have to execute the project by sourcing a location, partnering with companies for material procurement, manufacturing and assembly. 

**A quick overview of requirements:**

-	Suitable location (emergency hospitals, hotels, hostels, nursing homes...)
-	manufacturing partner (piping technicians, fire department, medical staff)
-	material (air blower, pipes, hoses, fittings, water tanks, face-masks, filters, oxygen supply)
